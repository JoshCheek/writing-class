Experiment #7: Extended Profiles
================================

For this exercise we are going to write a profile piece
about someone who has inspired or influenced our
career. These should relate to your thinking about work,
your daily processes, your history (you came to do what
you do), a role model, or a current hero in the industry.
In other words, this person does not have to work at 8th
Light (it could be a client, peer, acquaintance, teacher,
friend, or person who does other work that interests
you), but should have a relationship to how you approach
your career or your attitude about work. It would useful
to interview this person if possible, or else use other
sources to pull in as much outside research as you can.

The goal of this mini essay will be to answer the following questions:

1. Who is this person and what do they do? Describe their process, history, opinions, and how they have
changed, overcome hurdles, mentored, solved specific problems, or embodied values that you find
compelling.

2. How has this person influenced, taught, or motivated you? Tell a specific story or anecdote.
