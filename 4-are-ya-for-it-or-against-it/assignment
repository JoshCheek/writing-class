Experiment #4: Are Ya For It Or Against It?

You and your partner will be assigned an idea or subject to write about. One will be "Pro" this
idea, the other "Con." Your assignment is to write a persuasive argument for why we, as your
audience, should agree with your side of the argument. Be as detailed and specific as possible. It
might help to use facts, figures, quotes, anecdotes, stories, interviews, and humor. Next week we
will share these with the class and there will be a vote after each pair to determine who "won" the
argument. Let the competition begin!!!!
