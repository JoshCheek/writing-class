Unconventional Ideas Built With Logic
=====================================

position: pro

We live in a world whose primary avenue of innovation seems to be VC investors looking for social media sites
that target untapped demographics, and auto-tuned rap stars offering examples of the inverse relationship
between their money and their respect for women. In a world of rehashed mashups, cover song mixtapes, and formulaic culture,
how do we revitalize originality and ideation? How do continue to push the boundaries of progress?
We need an approach that has the ability to overcome the tainting our thought processes endure from existing in this mundane world.

When you know where you're going, you can only go where you intend. You must be able to imagine the destination
you are striving towards. Thus your potential destinations are limited by your imagination, by what you currently
know and can conceive of. Since our thoughts exist in our current framework for reality, our ideas fall into the
patterns this reality imposes.

To push progress and find destinations unimagined, we must play with ideas in their purest sense.
What is possible? What happens when we follow this thought process as far as we can, and then push it even further?

Lisp is the most innovative programming lanugage ever invented. If its authors had bound themselves to "how do we program a computer?"
they would have been stuck in the realm of ideas that led to Fortran and C. Instead, they looked at mathematics. They followed
these possibilities as far as they could go, and then rendered these into a programming language whose features were so
unconventional that they still continue to seed other languages, 55 years later. The possibilities of what they could do
could be logically considered and derived, they could take the development even into completely uncharted territory.

When you disregard the constraints of modern society and instead consider what is possible given the domain, then you can
build on that, pushing forward without knowing where you're going, making progress toward a hazy destination that might
not be there at all. Thus unconventional ideas manifest themselves in the right circumstances.

Wikipedia recounts the that "From November 17, 1947 to December 23, 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&T's Bell Labs in the United States,
performed experiments and observed that when two gold point contacts were applied to a crystal of germanium, a signal was produced with the output
power greater than the input." They later received the nobel prize "for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect".
Transistors later enabled computers, and are used in virtually all electronics. What invention can claim more relevance than the computer?
They didn't set out to make the transistor, they were just noticed a curious effect while playing within a domain, and went from there.

Unconventional ideas open worlds of opportunities, allow us to find better ways of doing things, increase our quality of life,
and solve problems considered unsolvable. We can't choose to come up with unconventional ideas, however, we must build up to them by
freeing our minds of the restrictions of reality and instead considering the rules of the domain, focusing on the logical possibilities,
not the desired outcomes.

"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
  Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man." --George Bernard Shaw (The Revolutionist's Handbook)
