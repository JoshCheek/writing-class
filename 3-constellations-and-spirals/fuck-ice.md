Fuck Ice
========

Some people assert that Ice is good because it keeps your drink cold.
But lets say you're at a party with your friends, and you order Jameson and Ginger ale with no ice,
and maybe English is the waitress' second language, and the music is kind of loud, so she doesn't quite catch that last part.
Purely a hypothetical.
There are two possibilities here.

The first is that you consume your drink before the ice melts.
In which case, you drank it quickly enough that it wouldn't have warmed up anyway, and the ice only served to displace your beverage,
causing your glass to turn up empty quicker than it otherwise would have, requiring you to catch the waitress' eye again to order another one.
This is expensive and annoying, so fuck ice.

The second is that you consume your drink slower than the ice melts, in which case, you will notice the potency and the tastiness waning,
as they are diluted by the ice's transitioning into water.
Now, you may disagree, but I don't like watered down Jameson and Ginger ale, so fuck ice.

But lets pretend there was merit to the assertion, lets say it does keep your drink cold... It Is Winter.
I arrived in a flannel-lined toggle coat and cute mittens that make me look like a penguin.
I'm not trying to cool down here, quit putting frozen shit in my drink.

Do you know when the last time I liked ice was? Never. Do you know when that is likely to change? Never.

Now maybe you're the kind of person who likes a second glass just for water so that you'll stay hydrated and feel better in the morning.
Watered down water is just water, so is it okay to put ice in the water? No. It is not.
You'll finish your water twice as fast because half of it is frozen.
Then you'll have to wait a few minutes between each sip, waiting for enough ice to melt to get some semblance of satisfaction.
Here's another thought, lets say the waiter is walking around with a pitcher of water, scanning for empty glasses.
What is more likely to catch his eye? A glass full of ice, or a glass full of nothing?

Google for "ice bacteria", the [fourth hit](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2036682/Chilling-truth-ice-drink-covered-bacteria.html)
shows that the United Kingdom's Health Protection Agency took a bunch of samples and found
unsatisfactory levels of coliform bacteria in thirty percent of them. THIRTY PERCENT.
What else did they find? Enterococci and E.coli, where do those come from? They come from your shit.
Ice is a scum-ridden bacteria infestation, a trojan horse teeming with disease.
